# Angular in-app feed example

This is an example Angular application showing the [Knock](https://knock.app) in-app feed within an Angular application. You
can use this as a starting point to power your own Angular in-app feed applications built on top of Knock.

This example uses the [`@knocklabs/client` JS SDK](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/javascript/overview).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
